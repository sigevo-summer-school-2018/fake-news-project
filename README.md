# fake-news-project
S3 Project to tackle the problem of fake news on the web and social media.

## Fake News
Currently social media has given a lot of power to every individual to raise his voice and raise his/her concern. People also use this medium to make other masses aware of the current world situation by telling news. People sometimes use this opportunity for other malicious activity by spreading fake news. This is done by for many reasons for gaining fame, misinforming society to change their opinion on any subject, etc. This has a huge impact on the society’s thinking and sometimes may cause social unrest.

Our objective is to design a classifier that distinguishes between authentic and fake news.

## Design thinking

### Problem
News content has some properties:
1. Source (optional)
2. Timestamp
3. Content: Text, Images, Video
4. Subject   
5. Title
6. Medium

But many news are Fake, the problem is that the truth about news, could
be different to each person depending on their political views, education,
culture, etc.

The costs in time and human resource needed to verify a message can be reduced
if we have an automatic system to classify content as Fare or Fact.

### Solutions
1. Train a classifier using text content only.
2. Train a classifier or predict a trust measure for sources.
3. Search for similar news in other sources and give a weight depending on the source.
4. Calculate a probability of the event described in the news. My dog was abducted by a UFO.
5. Generate fake news for training our classifiers.
6. Crowd source the classification task, asking persons what they think about the news.
