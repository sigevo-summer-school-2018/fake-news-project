# fake-news-project
S3 Project to tackle the problem of fake news on the web and social media.

## Fake News
Currently social media has given a lot of power to every individual to raise his voice and raise his/her concern. People also use this medium to make other masses aware of the current world situation by telling news. People sometimes use this opportunity for other malicious activity by spreading fake news. This is done by for many reasons for gaining fame, misinforming society to change their opinion on any subject, etc. This has a huge impact on the society’s thinking and sometimes may cause social unrest.

Our objective is to design a classifier that distinguishes between authentic and fake news.
